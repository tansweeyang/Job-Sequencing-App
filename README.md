# Job-Sequencing-App
Developed an app that finds a sequence of jobs with the maximum profit given a deadline using Java. <br>
• Responsible for applying greedy algorithm to solve the problem. <br>
• Applied greedy algorithm and dynamic programming, and their time complexity are compared. <br>
• Resulted in time complexity of O(n^2) using greedy algorithm and O(n) using dynamic programming.
